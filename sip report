EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Summer Internship Project (SIP) focused on conducting market research for the ranking of top B-Schools in India, with the objective of compiling, cleaning, validating, and organizing institutional data to support the 2025 rankings publication. The project involved systematic secondary research, outreach to institutions, and structured data management over an eight-week period.
In the initial phase, data was compiled from over 100 institutions based on previous year’s rankings. Information was manually gathered from emails, brochures, and official websites, and entered into pre-formatted Excel templates, forming the foundation of the database.
The second phase emphasized data cleaning and standardization. Duplicates and outliers were removed, fields such as fee structures, accreditations, and course names were standardized, and Excel formulas were used to ensure consistency. This created a reliable dataset for further evaluation.
Subsequent weeks focused on data enrichment and validation. Missing inputs were filled by directly contacting institutions, supplementing responses with verified public data such as infrastructure details, faculty size, and international collaborations. Independent verification improved the accuracy and credibility of the dataset.
Where institutions were unresponsive, follow-ups via calls and emails were conducted, recovering critical information on programs, placements, and batch strength. Fresh responses from over 30 institutions significantly improved the dataset’s completeness and recency.
The final stage of the internship involved structuring the validated data in alignment with the ranking methodology. Institutions were categorized, individual profiles were prepared, and index sheets were created for seamless navigation. The dataset was formatted with filters, color codes, and explanatory notes, ensuring usability for both editorial and analytics teams.
By the conclusion of the internship, a comprehensive and credible dataset was delivered, serving as a direct input for the 2025 B-School Rankings. Additionally, an executive summary of patterns and insights was prepared for senior editors, highlighting trends and data completeness across institutions.
This project enhanced skills in secondary research, data validation, Excel-based data management, institutional communication, and market analysis. It provided valuable 
                                                                                      2

CHAPTER-I
INTRODUCTION

The Summer Internship Project (SIP) was undertaken with the objective of contributing to the preparation of institutional rankings by developing a structured and reliable data repository. The central emphasis of the internship lay in the collection, validation, standardization, and organization of institutional data, thereby generating insights that would support the evaluation and ranking process.

The work commenced with the compilation of data from universities and business schools identified on the basis of the previous year’s listings. Information was manually collected from official websites, brochures, and institutional communications and subsequently entered into pre-formatted Excel templates. This exercise resulted in the creation of an initial database encompassing more than one hundred institutions with essential ranking parameters.

To enhance the integrity of the dataset, systematic data cleaning and standardization were undertaken. Duplicates and outliers were removed, and uniformity was established in fields such as fee structures, program nomenclature, and accreditations. Excel formulas were employed to ensure consistent formatting across the dataset, thereby generating a refined and structured database suitable for subsequent editorial and analytical review.

An important component of the process involved addressing data gaps through primary outreach. Follow-up emails and telephonic interactions facilitated the collection of updated details on academic programs, placements, and batch strength from over thirty institutions. This effort significantly improved the recency and completeness of the data repository. In parallel, supplementary information was gathered through a review of institutional websites and brochures, enabling the verification of infrastructure, faculty strength, international collaborations, and accreditations. Such cross-verification strengthened the credibility of the database by incorporating independently validated entries.

For institutions that did not provide responses, data recovery efforts were pursued through telephonic follow-ups and secondary research, with a response log maintained for communication tracking. Subsequently, validated data was aligned with the established ranking methodology. Institutions were segregated by category, and individual profiles were prepared in Excel, supported by index sheets to facilitate navigation across datasets.

The final stage involved formatting the consolidated dataset with filters, color codes, and explanatory footnotes, alongside the preparation of an executive summary highlighting data completeness and emerging patterns. The final deliverables were submitted to the editorial team, serving as critical inputs for the forthcoming 2025 institutional rankings publication.

Overall, the internship experience provided significant academic exposure to the principles of data accuracy, standardization, and verification. It further underscored the pivotal role of data-driven insights in enhancing the transparency, reliability, and credibility of institutional rankings.                                                                                 5

 Detailed Work Responsibilities
My work primarily involved compiling and recording institutional data from emails, brochures, and official websites, followed by cleaning, standardizing, and formatting large datasets in Excel. I actively reached out to institutions through emails, calls, and follow-ups to gather missing information and ensured accuracy by cross-verifying institutional claims with accreditation databases and independent reports. Additionally, I categorized institutions and prepared individual profiles aligned with ranking parameters, while also developing executive summaries and briefs for senior editors and research leads. Finally, I contributed to the preparation of the comprehensive dataset for the 2025 rankings publication.

  Tools, Platforms, and Channels Used
extensively worked with MS Excel for data entry, cleaning, formatting, and creating pivot tables, charts, and summaries. Using MS Word, I drafted summaries, notes, and reports to support research documentation. For institutional outreach and follow-ups, I managed email communication through Outlook and Gmail, while also conducting telephonic calls for direct interaction with academic representatives. Additionally, I utilized web browsers and PDF documents to extract secondary data from official websites, brochures, and accreditation reports. To ensure consistency and alignment with ranking parameters, I also worked with internal pre-formatted Excel templates for indexing and data organization.

CHAPTER-VII
SUMMARY OF PROJECT ANALYSYS AND FINDINGS

Introduction
The Summer Internship Project focused on market research and data compilation for India Today–MDRA B-School Rankings 2025. The primary objective was to build a comprehensive, credible, and structured database of Indian B-Schools by collecting, cleaning, validating, and organizing data from both primary and secondary sources.
The project scope covered 100+ institutions across India and involved multiple stages: data collection from official websites, brochures, and direct outreach; cleaning and standardizing datasets using Excel functions; verifying institutional claims through cross-checking with accreditation bodies and credible public data; and preparing structured profiles and summaries aligned with ranking parameters.
The research methodology combined primary data (emails, telephonic follow-ups, and institutional responses) with secondary research (archived reports, PDFs, and websites). Tools such as MS Excel and MS Word were extensively used for data management, formatting, pivot tables, charting, and report writing. Communication channels included emails, calls, and professional correspondence, which enhanced interpersonal and stakeholder engagement skills.
Throughout the project, significant challenges included incomplete institutional responses, inconsistent data formats, and time-bound validation requirements. These were addressed through persistent follow-ups, careful standardization, and structured reporting practices.
The analysis revealed several key findings:
•	Data Reliability Improves Through Verification: Many institutions overstated achievements in placements or infrastructure, which required independent validation.
•	Sectoral Patterns Identified: Trends in ROI, accreditations, and geographical distribution of top B-Schools were observed.
                                                                  18
•	Standardization is Critical: Uniformity in data (e.g., fees, faculty count, locations) enhanced comparability and usability for rankings.
•	Holistic Datasets Add Value: Incorporating additional parameters like international collaborations and infrastructure improved the ranking framework.
•	Professional Communication is Essential: Effective outreach and polite follow-ups directly impacted data completeness and credibility.
Ultimately, the project resulted in a well-structured, validated dataset that directly contributed to the 2025 B-School Rankings publication. It also provided hands-on exposure to real-world research processes, strengthened skills in data analytics and reporting, and demonstrated how structured research underpins credible rankings in the education sector.
